# TS Starter Project

Simple TypeScript scratchpad project for small experiments.

**Note**: this project makes heavy use of [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as it is. Replacing it with Node and NPM/PNPM/Yarn/YourFavouritePackageManager should be fairly trivial though.

Tech stack:

- 🌭 [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as a Node/NPM replacement
- 🔥 [TypeScript](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) (of course!)
- 🖨️ [Mutative](https://github.com/unadlib/mutative) for immutable operations
- 🤓 [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) for FP stuff
- 🔲 [Effect-TS] for some sweet FP Effects
- 🧪 [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) (coverage enabled, example benchmark file included)
- 😮‍💨 [eslint](https://eslint.org/)/[prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- 🐕 [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) + [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) + [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/)
- 🗒️VSCode/JetBrains settings included
